Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know it, but I feel it comin'
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong with you, and only you, baby

Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
Why I feel this way? I don't know, maybe
I think of her so much, it drives me crazy
I just don't want her to leave me

Don't you give me up, please don't give up on me
I belong with you and only you, baby

Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

What if she's fine
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long

What if she’s fine
It’s my mind that’s wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long

Don't you give me up, please don't give up on me
I belong with you, only you, baby

Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you
